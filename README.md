# Ecology 8540 Computational Workshops

May 2022  
Odum School of Ecology

The 2022 Ecology 8540 Computational Workshops are intensive modules
providing students with the skills needed to organize, analyze and
visualize data. This repository contains course materials for Module 2:
“Data visualization for ecology & epidemiology”

To register: <ideas@uga.edu>

### Module 2: Data visualization for ecology & epidemiology

CRN 63694

Monday, May 23, 9am-5pm  
Tuesday, May 24, 9am-5pm  
Wednesday, May 25, 9am-12pm

INSTRUCTORS  
John Drake (<jdrake@uga.edu>)  
Éric Marty (<emarty@uga.edu>)

This module presents basic principles and best practices for data
visualization in R, with examples drawn from ecology and epidemiology.
Topics include visualizing high-dimensional data, mapping, color,
interactive visualizations, and workflows for publication-ready figures.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with the
basic principles of data visualization. Students should be able to
create figures covering a range of chart types and problems in ecology
and infectious disease, applying best practices in data visualization.

Students will complete 6 in-class exercises on a range of topics. In
addition, students will work in groups to complete one longer project of
their choosing. Groups will present completed projects to the class at
the end of the course, and receive feedback from their peers.

## Downloading Github repo, setting up R/Rstudio

**Step 1. Github credentials**

You will need a GitHub account and a Personal Access Token (PAT) with
“scope” set to “repo”. If you do not have a GitHub PAT, you can create
one as follows:

1.  Log into GitHub on the web.
2.  Under your user icon, go to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal
    Access Tokens
3.  Click `Generate new token`.
4.  Name the token something relevant, click the box next to `repo`, set
    an expiration date if desired, and click `Generate token`.  
5.  Copy the token and save it somewhere safe and permanent. You will
    not be able to look up the token after you close the window.

You will use this token in place of a password during the next step.

**Step 2. Log in to the Ecology RStudio Server with your class login and
password**

<https://rstudio.ecology.uga.edu/>

**Step 3. Clone the class repository into a new R Project:**

File \> New Project \> Version Control \> Git

Repository URL: <https://github.com/CEIDatUGA/ECOL8540-datavis.git>

Click “Browse” to choose or create the directory to put the project in.

When asked, enter your PAT in place of a password.
