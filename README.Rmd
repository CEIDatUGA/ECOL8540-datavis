# Ecology 8540 Computational Workshops
May 2022  
Odum School of Ecology

The 2022 Ecology 8540 Computational Workshops are intensive modules providing students with the skills needed to organize, analyze and visualize data. This repository contains course materials for Module 2: "Data visualization for ecology & epidemiology" 

To register: ideas@uga.edu

### Module 2: Data visualization for ecology & epidemiology
CRN 63694

Monday, May 23, 9am-5pm  
Tuesday, May 24, 9am-5pm    
Wednesday, May 25, 9am-12pm

INSTRUCTORS
John Drake (jdrake@uga.edu)  
Ã‰ric Marty (emarty@uga.edu)

This module presents basic principles and best practices for data visualization in R, with examples drawn from ecology and epidemiology. Topics include visualizing high-dimensional data, mapping, color, interactive visualizations, and workflows for publication-ready figures.

## Lectures

1. Introduction (Drake)  
2. Data & Image Models (Marty)
3. Chart types (Drake)
4. Aesthetics & Color (Marty)
5. Perception (Marty)
6. Mapping (Drake)

## Exercises

1. Figure redesign (no code) (Eric)  
2. Annotated time series / multi time series (Eric)  
3. High-dimensional data (without color scale if possible) (Eric)  
4. Color excercise (Eric, John will give reference paper)  
2d heatmap. Issues: upper triangle, clustering, ordering, x = beta, y = virulence (model with disease induced mortality), R0 = color  
5. Workflows (Eric)  
6. Map (john)  


## Group projects (John)
5 groups of 4, 6 topics:

- COVID-19: Compare county and state-level patterns over time for the state of GA  
- COVID-19: Compare cases and mortality over time  
- West nile virus: County level virus data over time
- Lime disease: advance in last 2 decades
- Stochastic SIR model: 
  - summarize epidemic trajectories, spaghetti plots, confidence intervals, distributions, etc.
- ?
