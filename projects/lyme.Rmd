Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi*. 
*Borellia* is transmitted by by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*).
Lyme disease was first identified in Connecticut in 1975 and has been spreading in the United Since since that time.
Now, an average of 475,000 people are diagnosed with Lyme disease every year.

The CDC has produced a county-level public data set of Lyme disease for the period from 2000 to 2019.
These data may be accessed from the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/resources/datasurveillance/LD-Case-Counts-by-County-00-19.csv.
Information about data collection and limitationss of surveillance are available at https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/survfaq.html.
Your task is to create a visualization of these data that quantifies and communicates how Lyme disease has spread throughout the US during this period.
