A common visualization task in epidemiology and disease ecology is to plot a record of case counts over time, often referred to as the *epidemic curve*. 
The data are typically encoded with two variables, a date and the case count. 
An epidemic curve is just an ordinary line graph in two dimensions.
However, more complicated versions of the epidemic curve are often useful, for instance showing two curves simultaneously.
If those curves are of different magnitudes then they require different y-axes.
Additionally, we often find it useful to annotate time series.
This exercise teaches some of these tasks.
