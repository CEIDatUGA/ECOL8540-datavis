Maps that georeference non-spatial quantitative information may be especially difficult for the casual observer to properly interpret.
Maps of COVID-19 incidence were produced during the pandemic and used by many people for both public and personal decision-making. 
[One study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774639) looked at how knowledge risk perception and behavioral intentions were influenced by six different maps of COVID-19 prevalence in the US on May 11, 2022.

<small>[Figure 1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774639) Six maps of COVID-19 prevalence in the US on May 11, 2020 used in a study assessing the effectiveness of different map features on the public understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic.</small>

Some key findings of the study included:

- Maps of prevalance (per capita cases) translated poorly to knowledge about total cases.
- Choropleth maps were superior to bubble plots, perhaps because they de-emphasize the relative importance of large population centers and rural areas
- Small areas with high prevalence are hard to indicate on national maps
- Popular understanding was improved by aggregating information to the state level
- Maps of per capita prevalence were more informative than maps of total cases
- Viewing maps (versus not view maps) had no measurable impact on individual risk perception
- Viewing maps (versus not view maps) made viewers slightly more optimistic about societal risk
- Viewing maps (versus not view maps) had no influenze on behavior
- Viewing maps led to less accurate knowledge about total cases compared with having no information at all


# prompts

present info about both prev asnd tot case

locates infection in a way relevent to both public policy and individual decision making (consider scale)
(finer scale is not necessarily better)

todo: 

load covid data,   
generate basic choropleth etc.,   
eleborate prompts
