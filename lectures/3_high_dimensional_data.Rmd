# High-dimensional data visualization

## Encoding Trivariate (3D) Data 

### Surface Plot (with added color for redundancy)

Best when z data is smoothly varying as a function of x and y.

## Encoding Trivariate (3D) Data 

### 3D scatterplot 

Can encode fully 3D data. Data can be hard to see.

## Non-spatial 3D encodings

Plotting 3D space on a 2D surface makes it hard to read data accurately.  

Therefore, we give the 3rd variable (z) a non-spatial visual encoding:  

- Hue (Nominal)  
- Value (Ordinal, Quantitative)  
- Size / Area (Quantitative)  
- Shape (Nominal)   
-  etc.

Example: Bubble plots.

## Encoding Multivariate (nD) Data

### Trellis Plots 

Subdivide the design space to compare multiple plots, usually with a nominal or ordinal variable used as the basis for subdividing the space.

## Encoding Multivariate (nD) Data

### Small Multples 
A generalization of the idea of a trellis plot.

## Encoding Multivariate (nD) Data

### Scatterplot Matrix
A special case of the trellis plot, where the space is subdivided as a matrix of quantitative variables.

## Encoding Multivariate (nD) Data

### Scatterplot matrix  
+ extra dimensions

## Strategies for nD visualization

### Dimensional Reduction

- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) 

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/GaussianScatterPCA.svg/1200px-GaussianScatterPCA.svg.png?20160210062755)

- Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)  
- Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)  
- t-Dist. Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)  
- Isomap  
- Auto-Encoder Neural Networks Topological methods  
...

## Strategies for nD visualization:

- Avoid encoding too many dimensions  
- Reduce the problem space
- Try small multiples first   
- Try other established nD techniques  
- Use interaction, linked views, multiple views, etc.

Rarely does a single visualization answer all questions. Instead, the ability to generate appropriate visualizations quickly is key. 

## Graphic Exploratory Data Analysis 

Be wary of your assumptions. Start with them, but don't limit yourself by them.

Start with **univariate summaries** (single variables).

Next, start to consider relationships among variables.

**Iterative Exploratory Process:**

1. Formulate a question  
2. Construct graphic to address question  
3. Inspect “answer” and assess new questions  
4. Repeat...  

**Explore transformed data**

- invert scale  
- log scale or power scale  
- normalize  
- bin, grouped, etc.
