## The goal is to see

"The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see."

-- John Tukey

## Howard Wainer (1990) on Playfair and Tukey

Three points of agreement:  

1. Impact is important.  
2. Understanding graphs is not always automatic.

Two categories of good graphs:  

1. A *strongly good graph* shows us everything we need to know just by looking at it.   
2. A *weakly good graph* shows us everything we need to know just by looking at it, once we know how to look.  
3. A graph can show us things easily that might not have been seen otherwise

Legends and annotations can change a weakly good graph into a strongly good graph. Legends and annotations should not just label the graphical objects, but also identify what graphical features are *important*.
