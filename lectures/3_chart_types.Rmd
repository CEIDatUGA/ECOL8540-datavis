## The goal is to see

"The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see."

-- John Tukey

##Howard Wainer (1990) on Playfair and Tukey

Three points of agreement 1. Impact is important 2. Understanding graphs is not always automatic

Two categories of good graphs 1. A *strongly good graph* shows us everything we need to know just by looking at it 2. A *weakly good graph* shows us everything we need to know just by looking at it, once we know how to look 3. A graph can show us things easily that might not have been seen otherwise

Legends and annotations can change a weakly good graph into a strongly good graph. Legends and annotations should not just label the graphical objects, but also identify what graphical features are *important*.
